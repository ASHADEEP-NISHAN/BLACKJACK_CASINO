Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos and homes around the world. The game is also known as 21 because the primary objective is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Here are the basic rules of blackjack:

Objective:
The objective of blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without going over 21. If your hand exceeds 21, you "bust" and lose the game.

Card Values:

Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
Face cards (King, Queen, and Jack) are each worth 10 points.
Aces can be worth 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player more. This choice is made by the player.
